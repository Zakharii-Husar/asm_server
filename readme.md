### 1.CREATING WEB SOCKET

The syscall for creating a TCP socket requires 3 parameters:

 1. **%rdi**: domain in my case is TCP/IP. [AF_INET(Address family internet)](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/i/7.3?topic=families-using-af-inet-address-family) . AF_INET is used for IPv4 while AF_INET6 is for  IPv6.
 2. **%rsi**: type specify the type of socket (read the AF_INET link above).In my case I'm using connection oriented address family sockets (type SOCK_STREAM) which is used fo TCP protocol, as opposed to connectionless (type SOCK_DGRAM) UDP or raw network protocol (type SOCK_RAW) as the transport protocol.
 3. **%rdx**: protocol is usually zero by default which means it's gonna let the system "decide" which protocol to use based on previous 2 parameters, e.g.:
 ````
 AF_INET + SOCK_STREAM → TCP (IPPROTO_TCP)
 AF_INET + SOCK_DGRAM → UDP (IPPROTO_UDP)
 AF_INET6 + SOCK_STREAM → TCP (IPPROTO_TCP)
 AF_INET6 + SOCK_DGRAM → UDP (IPPROTO_UDP)
 ````

After successfully making the syscall the TCP Socket [fd (file descriptor)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_descriptor#:~:text=In%20Unix%20and%20Unix%2Dlike,a%20pipe%20or%20network%20socket.) is daved to **%rbx** register.


### 2.BINDING WEB SOCKET

The syscall for binding the above created  TCP socket takes 2 parameters:

 1. **%rdi**: socket file descriptor saved in **%rbx** during socket creation.
 2. **%rsi** : an address structure (**addr_in**), which contains the **address family**, **port**, and **IP address**.

### 3.LISTEN FOR CONNECTIONS

The listening syscall takes 2 arguments:

 1. **%rdi**: socket file descriptor (saved in **%rbx** while creating socket).
 2. **%rsi**: backlog (number of maximum connections that caan be in the que while server is busy to process their requests).

### 4. ACCEPTING CONNECTION

Here we get the control over connection handling. It runs a loop and does following:

 1. Takes the earlier created and bound socket.
 2. Block (wait) until client tries to onnect.
 3. When a client connects, create a new socket for communication with that client.
 4. Return the file descriptor for the new socket, which will be used to send/receive data to/from that specific client.

Syscall parameters for accepting a connection:

 1. **%rdi**:  the listening socket file descriptor (in **%rbx** since socket creation).
 2. **rsi**: A pointer to a struct sockaddr where the client address will be stored (in my case I don't care about it so passing zero).
 3. **%rdx**: a pointer to a length of the address. Since I'm not providing an address in this example, this is also NULL

When connection is accepted its file descriptor is saved in **%rdi**.

The new socket file descriptor (now in **%rdi**) is the one I'll use to send and receive data with this client, such as responding to HTTP requests. The original listening socket (in **%rbx**) remains open for further connections.

It's possible to use syscalls like **read** and **write** on this new socket to interact with the client.

After handling the connection, I can loop back and wait for the next connection by calling accept again.
