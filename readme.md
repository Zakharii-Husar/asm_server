### CREATING WEB SOCKET

The syscall for creating a TCP socket requires 3 parameters:

 1. **%rdi**: domain in my case is TCP/IP. [AF_INET(Address family internet)](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/i/7.3?topic=families-using-af-inet-address-family) . AF_INET is used for IPv4 while AF_INET6 is for  IPv6.

 2. **%rsi**: type specify the type of socket (read the AF_INET link above).In my case I'm using connection oriented address family sockets (type SOCK_STREAM) which is used fo TCP protocol, as opposed to connectionless (type SOCK_DGRAM) UDP or raw network protocol (type SOCK_RAW) as the transport protocol.

 3. **%rdx**: protocol is usually zero by default which means it's gonna let the system "decide" which protocol to use based on previous 2 parameters, e.g.:
 ````
 AF_INET + SOCK_STREAM → TCP (IPPROTO_TCP)
 AF_INET + SOCK_DGRAM → UDP (IPPROTO_UDP)
 AF_INET6 + SOCK_STREAM → TCP (IPPROTO_TCP)
 AF_INET6 + SOCK_DGRAM → UDP (IPPROTO_UDP)
 ````

After successfully making the syscall the TCP Socket [fd (file descriptor)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_descriptor#:~:text=In%20Unix%20and%20Unix%2Dlike,a%20pipe%20or%20network%20socket.) is daved to **%rbx** register.


### BINDING WEB SOCKET

The syscall for binding the above created  TCP socket takes 2 parameters:

1) **%rdi**: socket file descriptor saved in **%rbx** during socket creation.

2) **%rsi** : an address structure (**addr_in**), which contains the **address family**, **port**, and **IP address**.
