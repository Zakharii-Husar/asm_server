# Function: sock_read
# Implicit parameters:
# - %r12 Socket file descriptor;
# Return Values:
#   - %rax: Pointer to the response_content_buffer
#   - %rdi: Actual file size (size of the opened file)
#   - %rdx: Error code (0 if no error, negative value for specific errors)
# Side effects:
#   - Extracts the route and route extension into buffers
#   - Opens requested file into buffer
