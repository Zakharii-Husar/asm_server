Steps to Implement a Static File Server

1) Setup Your Assembly Environment: 
Ensure you have a working assembly development environment set up for your project.

2) Create Socket:
Use the socket API to create a TCP socket. This is similar to what you have already done in your earlier code.
Bind the socket to a specific IP address and port (e.g., 0.0.0.0:8080).

3) Listen for Connections:
Set the socket to listen for incoming connections using the listen system call.

4) Accept Connections:
Accept incoming connections using the accept system call. This will give you a new socket file descriptor to communicate with the client.

5) Read the HTTP Request:
Read the request from the client socket. The request will typically contain the HTTP method (e.g., GET) and the path to the requested file (e.g., /index.html).
You may want to parse the request to extract the requested file path.

6) Serve Static Files:
Check if the requested file exists on your server's filesystem.
If the file exists, read its contents and prepare an HTTP response with a 200 OK status code.
If the file does not exist, return a 404 Not Found response.

7) Send the HTTP Response:
Send the HTTP response back to the client through the accepted socket.
Close the client connection once the response is sent.

8) Loop to Handle Multiple Connections:
After serving one request, go back to accepting more connections. This way, your server can handle multiple clients in sequence.
